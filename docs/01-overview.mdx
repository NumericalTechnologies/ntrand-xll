## Numerical Technologies Random Generator for Excel

**NtRand**, Numerical Technologies's Random Number Generator for Microsoft Excel
is a software where a family of various random numbers such as
[standard normal (Gaussian) random numbers](/docs/glossary#normal-gaussian-random-numbers)
in Monte Carlo method is implemented as add-in functions available with Excel.
It also generates [multivariate correlation random numbers](/docs/glossary#multivariate-correlation-random-numbers).

NtRand uses [pseudo-random numbers](/docs/glossary#pseudo-random-numbers)
by [Mersenne Twister algorithm](/docs/glossary#mersenne-twister-algorithm),
featuring longer period and higher order of equidistribution, which is a
cynosure in simulation technology.

Multivariate Mote Carlo employs [antithetic variant method](/docs/glossary#antithetic-variant-method)
and [quadratic resampling](/docs/glossary#quadratic-resampling)
for higher accuracy. For more information, see
["Enhancement of Monte Carlo by Moment Matching."](/docs/faq#enhancement-of-monte-carlo-by-moment-matching)

## Why NtRand?

In the VaR computing for risk management, a larger scale Monte Carlo simulation
is often necessary. In this case, the built-in random numbers would not serve
well enough in ensuring the accuracy. Some solutions use the
[physical random numbers](/docs/glossary#physical-random-numbers).

However, they are less practical because no significant repeatability is observed
on any verification test and some special hardware is required.
[Mersenne Twister](/docs/glossary#mersenne-twister-algorithm) is one of
the approaches to **provide a pragmatic solution in VaR quantification**,
and widely incorporated in [NtSaaS®](https://ntsaas.numtech.com) , risk management
system developed by [Numerical Technologies Incorporated.](https://www.numtech.com/)

## Features

NtRand operates at very high speed with many advanced features. It enables you
to **build a several tens of dimensions** of practical
*Monte Carlo VaR calculating system* or **derivatives pricing model with the Excel**
running on your own computer. That is,
**almost all smaller-scaled VaR management systems** can be configured using NtRand.
We recommend NtRand for **_derivatives pricing_**, **_risk management studies_**,
**_preliminary test_** before introducing a costly calculating system, or writing **_your paper_**.

- Outstanding properties of longer period and higher order of equidistribution for **pseudo-random numbers** (random period of $2^{19937}-1$). For further information, visit the [Mersenne Twister Home Page](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/m-mat/MT/emt.html) hosted by assistant professor Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura at Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Japan.
- **Easy generation** of the multivariate correlation random numbers essential to *the Monte Carlo VaR calculation*.
- **High speed operation** enhanced by the efficient design in engineering. NtRand operates far faster than RAND function in Excel and easily generates random numbers for more than 10,000-time Monte Carlo.
- **Various moment matching methods** available to improve the convergence in Monte Carlo. Enables you to easily use the [antithetic variant method](/docs/glossary#antithetic-variant-method) and/or [quadratic resampling](/docs/glossary#quadratic-resampling). For more information, see ["Enhancement of Monte Carlo by Moment Matching."](/docs/faq#enhancement-of-monte-carlo-by-moment-matching)
- **Utilities to supplement the improvement of Monte Carlo's convergence** -- For [uniform/normal random numbers conversion](/docs/glossary#uniform-random-numbers), [the Box-Muller method](/docs/glossary#box-muller-method) is available in addition to [the inverse function method (Moro's algorithm)](/docs/glossary#inverse-function-method-moros-algorithm).
- **Random number generator and related utility functions for widely acknowledged following 17 different probability distributions widely acknowledged.**
