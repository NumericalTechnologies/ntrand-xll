# Installation

## Install

1.  If you have installed older version of NtRand on your PC, you must uninstall it first. You cannot overwrite existing NtRand module, because Microsoft Excel caches addins into its own repository. Read the [release note](https://www.ntrand.com/release-note/ "release note") carefully.
2.  Click the GET NOW button on the right to start downloading the zip file into an appropriate directory.
3.  On your computer, extract the downloaded NtRand###\_x86.zip or NtRand###\_x64.zip file and get the following files:

    NtRand\*\*\*.xll

    NtRand Excel add-in program

4.  Locate NtRand**_.xll to any directory. The latest version of Excel instructs a directory named "Addin" as default. Move NtRand_**.xll therein.
5.  Start Excel.
6.  Specifying NtRand\*\*\*.xll by your Excel versions (Before or after Excel 2007).
    - (Before Excel 2007) On the "Tools" menu, click "Add-ins...", and then click "Browse..." button to open a dialog box. Specify NtRand\*\*\*.xll, and then click OK.
    - (Excel 2007 or later) Click Microsoft Office button, click Excel Options, click Add-Ins, and then click GO button to open a dialog box. Specify NtRand\*\*\*.xll, and then click OK.
7.  In the dialog box, select the "NtRand Addin" check box, and then click OK.
